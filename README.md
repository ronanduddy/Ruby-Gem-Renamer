# Rename Gem

This Ruby Gem is a work in progress, its goal is to be able to rename gems. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rename_gem'
```

And then execute:

```Shell
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```Shell
gem install rename_gem
```

## Usage

```Shell
bundle exec rename_gem --from old_name --to new_name
```

## Development

Run `make test` to run all the tests or `make guard` to use guard for testing. You can also run `make irb` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
